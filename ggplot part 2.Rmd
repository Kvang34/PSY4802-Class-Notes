# Learning Outcomes
By the end of this class, students should be able to: 
- Explain how to alter information in the legend 
- Describe how to use facet wrap
- Explain how to export graphs


### Learning Outcome 1: Explain how to alter information in the legend
It can also be helpful to understand how to modify your legend: 
`+ theme(legend.position="none")` will remove the legend. You can also choose to move the legend to the top or bottom of the graph

Let's try this on a graph from the diamonds dataset: 
Create a subset of the diamonds dataset:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(diamonds)

# How to remove the legend 
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color=cut))+
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.position= "none")
```

We can also change the location: 
```{r}
# How to move the legend to the bottom of the graph 
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color=cut))+
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.position= "bottom")
```

To Change the legend title, you can use a couple of different codes, depending on the type of data: 
`scale_color_discrete(name="Title")` works for scatter plots filled in with a factor
`scale_fill_discrete(name="Title)` should work for a bar graph filled in by a factor
`scale_color_continuous()` and `scale_fill_continuous()` should work for a numeric fill
```{r}
# How to change the names in the legend 
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color=cut))+
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.position= "bottom")
```

### Practice:

1) make a graph of disp and hp from mtcars. Include miles per gallon as a third variable
```{r}

```

2) Move the legend to the top of the graph
```{r}

```

3) Remove the legend from the graph 
```{r}

```

4) Change the title of the legend
```{r}

```

### Learning Outcome 2: Describe how to use facet wrap
Facet Wrap allows us to incorporate a third variable in another way. Specifically, it panels graphs so that we can make an individual graph for each level of a factor.

we need to make a graph and save it (we'll use carat and price)
```{r}
mpgByCyl <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl)%>%
  summarize(mean = mean(mpg))

ggplot(mpgByCyl, aes(cyl, mean)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity")

mpg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg))+
  geom_bar() 
mpg+facet_wrap(~cyl)
  
```
then we'll use cut to create the facets
```{r}

```

```{r}

```

### Practice: 
1) create a facet wrap graph to generate a scatterplot of mpg and hp based on the number of cylinders a car has
```{r}

```

### Learning Outcome 3: Explain how to export graphs
to export graphs, I use the command `ggsave()`
Specifically, you can use the following arguments: 
`ggsave("name of graph", width, height, units, dpi)`
```{r}

```
I don't usually specify a path in ggsave, but make sure my r code is in the directory I'd like it to be saved in. you can check your working directory by using this code
```{r}

```
you can change your working directory using this code: 
```{r}

```
